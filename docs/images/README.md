# Demo Images

## Adding GUI Preview GIF

To add a GUI preview GIF:

1. **Record the GUI in action:**
   - Open the application: `product-image-optimizer-gui`
   - Record your screen while dragging files and processing
   - Use tools like:
     - Windows: Xbox Game Bar (Win + G) or OBS Studio
     - Mac: QuickTime or ScreenFlow
     - Linux: Kazam or SimpleScreenRecorder

2. **Convert to GIF:**
   - Use online tools like ezgif.com or gifski
   - Keep file size under 5MB for GitHub
   - Recommended dimensions: 800x600px
   - Frame rate: 15-20 fps

3. **Add to repository:**
   - Save as `gui-preview.gif` in this directory
   - It will automatically appear in README.md

## Placeholder

Until you record a demo, the README will show a placeholder.
The GUI is fully functional - just needs to be recorded!

### What to show in the demo:

1. Open the application
2. Drag and drop some images
3. Select a preset (e.g., "Instagram Square")
4. Click "Process Images"
5. Show the progress bar
6. Show the completion message
7. Open output folder to show results

Keep it under 10 seconds for best impact!
